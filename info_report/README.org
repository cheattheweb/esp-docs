Found an old project that can packet inject wifi.
It can do Dos attacks, capture packets.
But it may not be able to capture packets properly for hash cracking.

- You can power the esp32 board using VIN / 3V3 / 5V & GND, but one source at a time.
- The DOIT ESP32 DevKit V1 is probably the most famous development board based on the equally popular ESP32 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif. In fact, the DevKit V1 is more popular than any official board from Espressif. On this page, you will find a beautiful pinout diagram crafted by =CIRCUITSTATE= and other pin references for the [[https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-devkitc.html#get-started-esp32-devkitc-board-front][ESP32 DevKit V1 board.]]
- =EN= pin This is the reset pin. Connecting this pin to GND will reset the ESP32. This pin is normally pulled-up. The EN button will pull it LOW when you press it.
- Many of the peripheral functions can be mapped to any of the GPIO pins using the [[https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/tutorials/io_mux.html][GPIO Mux]] block of the ESP32.

- Found a project named ESP32 Maradure that can do almost everything I wanted to do with the esp32
- It has a very verbose wiki too
- Looks like maradur v6 uses a Li-ion battery
